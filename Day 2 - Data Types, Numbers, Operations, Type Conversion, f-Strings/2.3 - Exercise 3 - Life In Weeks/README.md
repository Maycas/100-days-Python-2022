# LIFE IN WEEKS

# Instructions

I was reading [this article by Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) - Your Life in Weeks and realized just how little time we actually have.

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

&emsp; You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.


##Â Example

`56`
`You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.`
