# CAESAR CIPHER

# Instructions

A [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is a way of encrypting messages during the times of Rome where the encryption happens by shifting the letters in a sentence by a certain amount of positions.

For example:
```
text = "home"
shift = 1
```
An encoded text will be:
```
H O M E
I P N F
```
The letter next to each character in alphabetical order is the one that is chosen to generate the encrypted word

Create a program that asks the user the following:
- Action to perform: `encode` / `decode`
- Text to encode or decode
- Number of shifted positions you want to use
