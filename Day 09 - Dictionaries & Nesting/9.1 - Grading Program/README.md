# GRADING PROGRAM

## Instructions

You have access to a database of `student_scores` in the format of a dictionary. The **keys** in `student_scores` are the **names** of the students and the **values** are their exam **scores**.

Write a program that **converts their scores to grades**. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called `student_grades` that should contain student **names** for **keys** and their **grades** for **values**. The final version of the `student_grades` dictionary will be checked.

This is the scoring criteria:

&emsp; Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

&emsp; Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

&emsp; Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

&emsp; Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

## Example

```
{
    'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations',
    'Ron': 'Acceptable',
    'Hermione': 'Outstanding',
    'Draco': 'Acceptable',
    'Neville': 'Fail'
}
```
