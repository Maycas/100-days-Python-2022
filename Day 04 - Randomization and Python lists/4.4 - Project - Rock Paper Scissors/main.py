# Determining the winner
# Â Looking at how the options are structured. A player always beats the option on his left, and loses
# against the option on his right. So, if player - computer == 1, then the player wins. Then, if the
# player selects scissors and computer selects rock, then player the player loses
# (player - computer == 2). Finally, there's an edge case, where player selects rock and computer
# selects scissors, then player - computer = -2.
# In that last case, we need to convert this -2 using the modulo operator so it becomes a 1 and the
# player wins, so doing (player - computer) % 3 = 1, and then the player wins.
