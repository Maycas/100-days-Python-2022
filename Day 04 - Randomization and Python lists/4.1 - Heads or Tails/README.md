# HEADS OR TAILS

## Instructions

You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

When you run the code, just use a random number as the seed. e.g. 67346 It doesn't matter what you chose, it's only for our testing code to check your work.

There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

In this code `Heads == 1` and `Tails == 0`

## Example

```
Heads
```

or

```
Tails
```
