# DEBUGGING FizzBuzz

## Instructions

- Read this the code in initial.py
- Spot the problems 🐞.
- Modify the code to fix the program.
- Fix the code so that it works and passes the tests when you submit.

The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game:

- Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
- When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
- When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
- And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".
