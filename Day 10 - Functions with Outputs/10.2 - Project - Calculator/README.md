# CALCULATOR

# Instructions

- Implement a calculator app that allows a user to perform the following operations:
  - Add (+)
  - Subtract (-)
  - Multiply (\*)
  - Divide (/)
- Once an operation has been performed, as in normal calculators, the user should be able to keep performing operations on the previous result, giving him an option to either continue or stop the script execution.
