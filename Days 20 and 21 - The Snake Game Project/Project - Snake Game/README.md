# PROJECT 20, 21 - THE SNAKE GAME

## Instructions

Create the [Snake Game](https://www.gamepix.com/play/snake-3310-html5) that became so popular in the age of [Nokia
3310](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310). In order to do so, you will need to use the Turtle Graphics
interface and follow the next steps:

1. Create the snake body, by aligning 3 squares on the screen.
2. Move the snake, so it continuously moves forward and we change its direction.
3. Add keyboard control, so we can move the snake.
4. Detect collision with food, so once the snake collides, a new piece of food randomly appears in the screen and
   the snake increases in size.
5. Create a scoreboard.
6. Detect a collision with wall, so the game ends.
7. Detect a collision with the snake itself, so the game ends too.

## How to run the game
