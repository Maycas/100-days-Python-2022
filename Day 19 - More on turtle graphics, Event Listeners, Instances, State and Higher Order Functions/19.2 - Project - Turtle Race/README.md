# PROJECT 19 - TURTLE RACE

## Instructions

Using the Turtle library create a program that will:

- Ask the user for a color from the rainbow (`red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`), which will
  correspond to a turtle color you bet it will win the race.
- Create turtles with those colors and line them up at the start
- Make them randomly move and, as soon as one reaches the end of the canvas, determine the winner and inform the
  user if they have won the bet.
